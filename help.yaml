      pass a single letter as an argument to see its distribution, i.e.,
        total frequency,
        frequency in each slot,
        and letters sorted by how often they precede and follow it
          sorted least to most common
          (# represents a word boundary)
      e.g, "l e" to see data for "e"
  - name: zero argument
    abbr: '0'
    msg: |
      alternatively, pass no argument to see data for all letters, i.e.,
        total frequency & frequency in each slot
      e.g., "l"

      pass an evaluator name followed by, 
        a number of words to fetch,
        optionally 
          an number to offset the fetch by from the end of the list,
          a "-" if you want to fetch from the bottom instead of the top

      pass a range to see results for all words within that range
        range boundaries can be specified by either numerical score or a word itself
        ranges must contain a ":", but do not require either an upper or lower bound
        ranges formatted as "start:end"
      e.g., 
        "v positional :50" to see all words with a score less than 50 with no lower bound
        "v positional chose:" to see all words with a score at least as high as that of "chose"

      msg: |
        shows a list of all letters ranked by how many matches they have

      the 2nd argument of g (the guess' result) allows only 3 types of characters:
        "b" (blank) the letter guessed in that slot doesn't occur anywhere in the target word
        "y" (yellow) the letter guessed in that slot occurs in a different slot in the target word
        "g" (green) the letter guessed in that slot occurs in that slot in the target word
